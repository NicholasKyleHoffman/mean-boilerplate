# MEAN Boilerplate

## Lightweight implementation of the "MEAN Stack"

*Modular, easy-to-use (yet powerful) boilerplate for building MEAN-powered apps & sites.*

This boilerplate includes:

 - Full MEAN Stack usage (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS & NodeJS)
 - MVC structure
 - YAML configuration capabilities
 - nodemon script for startup/development
 - Coffeescript as main scripting language
 - LESS as main styling language
 - IE Fixes 
 - Bower usage
 - Twitter Bootstrap, jQuery, Angular-Resource (for AngularJS) & Font-Awesome included by default
 - Built-in error handling
 - SEO Optimizations
 - Built-in crypted-auth restriction for accesing admin-only content
 - Built-in multi-thread support (clusterization)

It's worth to mention that the boilerplate uses the **latest stable version** available from all of it's dependencies/libraries on each project creation, and this repository gets constantly updated so the boilerplate can keep up with non-backward compatible changes and/or deprecations as they surge. This project it's meant to be production-focused, so use it with confidence ;)

### Usage

Assuming you already have the needed **MEAN Stack** pieces installed on your computer/server (**MongoDB**, **NodeJS** & **ExpressJS**); plus **Git** and **Bower**, just run:


    1. git clone https://github.com/Jmlevick/mean-boilerplate.git MY_APP
    2. cd MY_APP
    3. git init
    4. npm install
    5. bower install

Replacing **MY_APP** with the name of the app/site you wanna create... To see your newly created app in action, just run:

    npm start
    
From inside your app's folder and then open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.
